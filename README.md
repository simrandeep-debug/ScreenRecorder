# ScreenRecorder

This is a screen recording app created using Python and other modules (Pyautogui, numpy and open-cv)

Steps to Record Screen :

1. Make sure that python (latest version recommended) is installed on your machine.
To check if python is installed on your machine :

Open Command Prompt/Terminal/Bash > Type "Python" or "Py" and hit "Enter".
If python is already installed , it will show the version details or will redirect you to Microsoft  Store from which python can be downloaded and installed .

2. There are other ways to install Python .

Either install python from App Store or you can visit https://www.python.org/downloads/
Select the version you want to install (Its always recommended to download the latest version)

After downloading the required version , run the executable file and proceed with the recommended settings until setup is complete .

3. After installing , to check that python has been installed , do the following : 
open Command Prompt/Terminal/Bash > Type "Python" or "Py" and hit "Enter".
If python is  installed , it will show the version details

4. Now that Python is installed , next step is to run the screenRecorder.py file 


There are multiple ways to do this .

a. The best way is to take advantage of Python Interpreter .
If you are using a modern text editor like Visual Studio Code, you can directly execute the python script without having to use terminal/command line for this . (Make sure that you download the recommended extension for the version , incase of VSCode , the extension name is : Intellisense Pylance).

b. Open command line in the required folder and type the below command :
Open Command Prompt/Terminal/Bash > Type "py -3 screenRecorder.py"

c. Open File Explorer and double click on the icon of the script .


************************* NOTE ***********************************

This is only a beta version of the app and many more updates would be done in the future releases.
However , this version of the script serves the purpose quite well and this can be used to record anything you want on your PC , for as much time as you want .

In the next release , I will try to add "Audio Capabilities" in the script so that it is easier to explain to others , plus it will be made sure that the app is made more stable along with other improvements and ideas that may or may not be implemented.
